# MetastaticCancerDetection
In this project, I create a CNN model to identify metastatic cancer in CT scans using PyTorch. This project was a submission in a Kaggle competition found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview. Feel free to contribute to the project to obtain better results!
